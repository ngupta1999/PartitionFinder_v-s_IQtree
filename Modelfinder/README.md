# DESCRIPTION
### Command-line
    iqtree -s alignment.nex -spp alignment.nex -m MFP+MERGE
(To perform Modelfinder to contruct tree using the best partitioning scheme found)
###  Results
 1. AICc value was found to be 37199.6958
 2. Number of independent parameters were found to be 130(less than partitionfinder which has 146 parameters).
 3. IQtree merged the two partitions that might have evololved under the same situations.
