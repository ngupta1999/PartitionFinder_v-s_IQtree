# PartitionFinder v/s ModelFinder
  ## Results
      Different partitioning schemes were observed in both the analysis.
      The best partitioning scheme of IQtree had merged two genes together in order to have fewer independent variables. 
  IQtree best partioning scheme is shown below
  
       DNAF, ef1a_1stpos_COI_1stpos = 1-649\3, 650-1415\3
       DNAF, ef1a_2ndpos_COI_2ndpos = 2-649\3, 651-1415\3
       DNAF, ef1a_3rdpos = 3-649\3
       DNAF, COI_3rdpos = 652-1415\3
       DNAF, 16S = 1416-1897
       DNAF, mitochondrial_genome = 650-1897
       DNAF, nuclear_genome = 1-649
