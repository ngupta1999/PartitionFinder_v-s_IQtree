# DESCRIPTION
### 1. Commandline 
       python "<path to the PartitionFinder.phy file>" "<path to the folder containing alignment and configuration file>"
NOTE: Alignment file and the configuration file must be in the same folder
### 2. Configuration File 
       models = all
       (To consider all the 56 possible models)
       schemes=all
       (Since, the dataset contains datablocks less than 12 so using "all" is computaionally feasible and will give more accurate results)
### 3. Results
All 56 models were considered with +I, +G, +I+G, version of each. 

Total number of partitioning schemes were 877 with scheme AICc value 37169.4598237

Total number of paramerters were 146
